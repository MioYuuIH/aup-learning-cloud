# AUP Learning Cloud

AUP Learning Cloud is a tailored JupyterHub deployment designed to provide an intuitive and hands-on AI learning experience. It features a comprehensive suite of AI toolkits running on AMD hardware acceleration, enabling users to learn and experiment with ease.

![Software Architecture](docs/imgs/software-stack.png)

## Learning Solution

AUP Learning Cloud offers the following Learning Toolkits:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only [**Deep Learning**](projects/DL) and [**Large Language Model from Scratch**](projects/LLM) are available in the v1.0 release.

- [**Computer Vision**](projects/CV) \
Includes 10 hands-on labs covering common computer vision concepts and techniques.

- [**Deep Learning**](projects/DL) \
Includes 12 hands-on labs covering common deep learning concepts and techniques.

- [**Large Language Model from Scratch**](projects/LLM) \
Includes 9 hands-on labs designed to teach LLM development from scratch.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to deploy AUP Learning Cloud on a single machine in a development or demo environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen™ AI Halo Device (e.g., AI Max+ 395, AI Max 390)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM (64GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Docker**: Install Docker and configure for non-root access

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply group changes without logout (or logout/login instead)
newgrp docker
```

> **Note**: See [Docker Post-installation Steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) and [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for details.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMDResearch/aup-learning-cloud.git
cd aup-learning-cloud/deploy/
sudo ./single-node.sh install
```

After installation completes, open http://localhost:30890 in your browser. No login credentials are required - you will be automatically logged in.

### Script Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `install` | Full installation (K3s, tools, GPU plugin, images, JupyterHub) |
| `uninstall` | Complete removal of all components |
| `upgrade-runtime` | Upgrade JupyterHub deployment |
| `build-images` | Build and import container images |
| `install-tools` | Install Helm and K9s only |
| `install-runtime` | Deploy JupyterHub only |
| `remove-runtime` | Remove JupyterHub only |

Example:
```bash
# Upgrade JupyterHub after configuration changes
sudo ./single-node.sh upgrade-runtime

# Rebuild images after modifying Dockerfiles
sudo ./single-node.sh build-images
```

## Manual Installation

For users who prefer step-by-step manual installation or need more control over the deployment process:

- [Multi-Node Cluster Deployment](deploy/README.md#multi-node-cluster-deployment) - Production deployment with Ansible playbooks

## Key Features

### Hardware Acceleration

AUP Learning Cloud provides a multi-user Jupyter notebook environment with the following hardware acceleration:

- **AMD GPU**: Leverage ROCm for high-performance deep learning and AI workloads.
- **AMD NPU**: Utilize Ryzen™ AI for efficient neural processing unit tasks.
- **AMD CPU**: Support for general-purpose CPU-based computations.

### Flexible Deployment

Kubernetes provides a robust infrastructure for deploying and managing JupyterHub. We support both single-node and multi-node K3s cluster deployments.

### Authentication

Seamless integration with GitHub Single Sign-On (SSO) and Native Authenticator for secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Auto-admin on install**: Initial admin created automatically with random password
- **Dual login**: GitHub OAuth + Native accounts on single login page
- **Batch user management**: CSV/Excel-based bulk operations via scripts

### Storage Management and Security

Dynamic NFS provisioning ensures scalable and persistent storage for user data, while end-to-end TLS encryption with automated certificate management guarantees secure and reliable communication.

## Available Notebook Environments

Current environments are set up as `RESOURCE_IMAGES` in `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub`. These settings should be consistent with `Prepullers` in `runtime/values.yaml`.

| Environment | Image                                    | Version | Hardware                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Base CPU    | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-default` | v1.0    | CPU                             |
| CV COURSE   | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-cv`    | v1.0  | GPU (Strix-Halo) |
| DL COURSE   | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-dl`    | v1.0  | GPU (Strix-Halo) |
| LLM COURSE  | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-llm`   | v1.0  | GPU (Strix-Halo)                |
