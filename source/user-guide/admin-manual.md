# Explanation for JupyterHub components

## Multi-login Authenticator

```python

c.MultiAuthenticator.authenticators = [
    {
        "authenticator_class": CustomGitHubOAuthenticator,
        "url_prefix": "/github",
    },
    {
        "authenticator_class": SimpleGroupAuthenticator,
        "url_prefix": "/local",
    },
]
```
This is an example setting for multi-login. It uses `CustomGitHubOAuthenticator` for GitHub login and `SimpleGroupAuthenticator` for local login. The `url_prefix` is used to distinguish between the two login methods. And the callback URL is set to `/hub/<method>/oauth_login`.

To enable multi-login, we use `MultiAuthenticator` which should be manually added to Hub mirror using `RUN pip install jupyterhub-multiauthenticator`.

The display of multi-login method on each page are reloaded in `CustomMultiAuthenticator`. We can manually edit the login options for each login methods.
```python
class CustomMultiAuthenticator(MultiAuthenticator):
    def get_custom_html(self, base_url):

        html = []

        for authenticator in self._authenticators:
            name = getattr(authenticator, "service_name", "authenticator")
            login_service = getattr(authenticator, "login_service", name)
            url = authenticator.login_url(base_url)

            if name ==  LOCAL_ACCOUNT_PREFIX:
                # LOCALACCOUNT
                html.append(f"""
                <div class="login-option mb-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <form action="{url}" method="post">
                    <input type="hidden" name="_xsrf" value="{{{{ xsrf }}}}" />
                    <div class="mb-4">
                    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username"
                            class="block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
                            required />
                    </div>
                    <div class="mb-4">
                    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"
                            class="block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
                            required />
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit"
                            class="w-full py-2 px-4 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-medium rounded-md">
                    Use LocalAccount Login
                    </button>
                </form>
                </div>
                """)
            else:
                # OAuth Button
                html.append(f"""
                <div class="login-option mb-4">
                <a role="button" class="w-full inline-block text-center py-3 px-4 bg-gray-800 text-white
                                    rounded-md hover:bg-gray-900 font-medium"
                    href="{url}{{% if next is defined and next|length %}}?next={{{{next}}}}{{% endif %}}">
                    Use {login_service} Login
                </a>
                </div>
                """)

        return "\n".join(html)
```

For the specific settings for each login method, please refer to the corresponding authenticator class.

## RemoteLabSpawner

In this script, we allocate resources for each user based on their permissions, for example GitHub teams. From the resources we granted, we will generate a resource allocation webpage for them. According to the resource user chooses, we will change the spawn settings for each image. When the user click the `Start` button, it assign a timer to stop the user's session. The timer should be changed in the frontend, please locate `value="20"` for further changes.

# Workflow

This describes some workflows for AUP Learning Cloud.

## Workflow 1: Apply config changes

1. Edit `runtime/values.yaml`
2. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait. You can check it status with the `k9s` command.

## Workflow 2: add a new resource image

1. Create a new folder under `dockerfiles`, for example `dockerfiles/NewImage`.
2. Create a new Dockerfile under `dockerfiles/NewImage`, for example `dockerfiles/NewImage/Dockerfile`.
3. Write a new Dockerfile, and prepare `build.sh` for the image. Suggested starter image is `rocm/pytorch:latest` (~60GB).
4. Before actually pushing to Docker Hub, we suggest you to build and test image locally. For example: remove the `start.sh` script and use `docker run` to test on your local machine.
5. Give the name and tag for the image in `build.sh`.
6. Run `build.bash` to build and push to ghcr. Make sure you do have the permission to push to ghcr.
7. Add the new image to `runtime/values.yaml` as prepuller.
8. Add the new image to `dockerfile/Hub/templates/resource_options_form.html` for front page settings.
9. Add the new image in `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py`. Include `RESOURCE_IMAGES`, `RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS` and `TEAM_RESOURCE_MAPPING`.
10. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait. For new images, it may take up 3 hours for prepuller depending on the cluster network. You can inspect the status by `k9s` command. If there is any node halt, you can manually delete to restart the prepuller pods. If there is still halts, you can `ssh` into the node and `sudo systemctl restart k3s-server` to restart the k3s server.
11. If it takes too long, and causing `pending-upgraded` failure. You should list out past versions of the image by `helm history jupyterhub -n jupyterhub` . Then you can rollback to a previous version by `helm rollback jupyterhub <version> -n jupyterhub`. After the rollback, you can run `scripts/helm_update.bash` again.


## Workflow 3: update a existing image

1. Edit the version settings in `build.sh`, `values.yaml` and `jupyterhub_config.py`.
2. Build and push to ghcr.
3. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait.
If there is any problem, refer to `step10~11` in `Workflow 2`.

## Workflow 4: edit resource-limitation of an existing image (backend and frontend)
1. Edit `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py`. Especially `RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS` and `TEAM_RESOURCE_MAPPING`.
2. If you hope to change user permissions for a image, you can edit `TEAM_RESOURCE_MAPPING`. For localAccount users, you can edit `RemoteLabKubeSpawner::get_user_teams`.
3. If you hope to change ths information on webpage, you can edit `resource_options_form.py::RESOURCE_SPECS`.
4. If you made changes to webpage, you should rebuild the hub image and push to ghcr. The update image version in `values.yaml`.
5. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait.

## Workflow 5: change login settings (methods, account, password, localAccount...)

1. You can change the login method in `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py`, with `c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = CustomMultiAuthenticator`.
2. To config GitHub OAuth, you should refer to this [post](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/configuration/config-ghoauth.html). The main configs are in `runtime/values.yaml`.
3. To config localAccount, you should refer to `SimpleGroupAuthenticator`. The main configs are in `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py`. All users within one group shares the same password. 
4. To temporary ban login methods for testing cases, you can edit `runtime/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py`, to set`c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = "dummy"`. Thus any passwd and username will be accepted.
5. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait.

## Workflow 6: change announcement on login page

1. Change html lines in `runtime/values.yaml`.
2. Run `scripts/helm_update.bash` and wait.
